# SiLKiE — Standardized List for Kit & Equipment  
*A clean, modern application for building organized lists and managing gear.*

SiLKiE is a project I'm actively developing that helps users create structured lists, plans, and equipment inventories. It’s designed for anything from training events to outdoor trips to personal readiness — anywhere a clear, organized checklist or gear list is helpful.

This repository exists purely to **share my development progress** with friends, collaborators, and anyone interested in following along. It contains no sensitive code, just high-level updates and milestone tracking.
